h1. Rails3-Application-Templates

These application generator templates give you a Rails 3 skeleton or starter app you can deploy in minutes.

The templates combine "Mongoid":http://mongoid.org/ with "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise. Mongoid is a datastore that gives you quick development without schemas or migrations. Devise gives you ready-made authentication and user management.

h4. Applications

The templates can be used to build the following complete applications:

* "rails3-mongoid-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/
* "rails3-subdomain-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-subdomain-devise/

h4. Tutorials

There are detailed tutorials to show how each application is built:

* "Tutorial for rails3-mongoid-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/wiki/Tutorial-%28Walkthrough%29
* "Tutorial for rails3-subdomain-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-subdomain-devise/wiki/Tutorial-%28Walkthrough%29

h4. Template Recipes

These application generator templates are assembled from "recipes". 

You can see a collection of useful template recipes:

* "rails-template-recipes":https://github.com/fortuity/rails-template-recipes

Use the recipes to customize your own application generator templates.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.8.7 or 1.9.2)
* Rails (version 3.0.4 or newer)

bq. You MUST be using Rails 3.0.4 or newer. Generating a Rails application from an "HTTPS" URL does not work in Rails 3.0.3 and earlier versions.

I recommend installing rvm, the "Ruby Version Manager":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/, to manage multiple versions of Rails.

If you are using rvm, you can see a list of the Ruby versions currently installed:
@$ rvm list@

Check that appropriate versions of Ruby and Rails are installed in your development environment:
@$ ruby -v@
@$ rails -v@

You will also need:

* A working installation of "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ (version 1.6.0 or newer)

If you don't have MongoDB installed on your computer, you'll need to install it and set it up to be always running on your computer (run at launch). On Mac OS X, the easiest way to install MongoDB is to install "Homebrew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ and then run the following:

<pre>
brew install mongo
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chmod -Rv 777 /data/
</pre>

h2. Generating the Application

Generate a new Rails application with the command:

@$ rails new app_name -m https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates/raw/master/rails3-mongoid-devise-template.rb@

or

@$ rails new app_name -m https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates/raw/master/rails3-subdomain-devise-template.rb@

bq. You MUST be using Rails 3.0.4 or newer. Generating a Rails application from an "HTTPS" URL does not work in Rails 3.0.3 and earlier versions.

This creates a new Rails app (with the @app_name@ you provide) on your computer.

The application generator template offers you the following options:

* set up your view files using the Haml templating language
* use jQuery instead of Prototype
* install the heroku gem for deployment to Heroku

If you wish to "change the recipe" to generate the app with your own customized options, you can copy and edit the template file.
