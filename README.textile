h1. Rails3-Application-Templates

These application generator templates give you a Rails 3 skeleton or starter app you can deploy in minutes.

These application templates were created using the "rails3_devise_wizard":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3_devise_wizard gem which provides a convenient way to assemble a reusable application template by selecting various "recipes" for popular Rails development packages.

The application generator templates will ask you for various preferences:

* Would you like to use jQuery instead of Prototype? (for Rails 3.0)
* Would you like to use jQuery UI? (for Rails 3.0 or 3.1)
* Would you like to use Haml instead of ERB?
* Would you like to use RSpec instead of TestUnit?
* Would you like to use factory_girl for test fixtures with RSpec?
* Would you like to use Cucumber for your BDD?
* Would you like to use Mongoid to connect to a MongoDB database?
* Would you like to use Devise for authentication?
* Would you like to use OmniAuth for authentication? 
* Would you like to set a robots.txt file to ban spiders?

h4. Applications

The templates can be used to build the following complete applications:

* "rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber
* "rails3-mongoid-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/
* "rails3-mongoid-omniauth":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-omniauth/
* "rails3-subdomain-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-subdomain-devise/

h4. Tutorials

There are detailed tutorials to show how each application is built:

h2. Suggested Use

Any developer can quickly generate a Rails web application using the rails new command. In practice, experienced Rails developers typically add an assortment of useful additional packages (gems) before beginning development of any web application. A developer often uses the same set of packages to get started and may create a "starter app" that can be copied and reused for any new project.

These application templates integrate the most commonly used packages that many Rails developers include in a "starter app." It can be a hassle to integrate some of the most commonly used packages, particularly when new versions are released and there are minor "gotchas" that interfere with packages working together. By using these  application templates, you'll have a ready-to-run app without the integration "gotchas". Each has a detailed tutorial so you'll see exactly how the application was assembled.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.8.7 or 1.9.2)
* Rails (version 3.0.5 or newer)

bq. You MUST be using Rails 3.0.4 or newer. Generating a Rails application from an "HTTPS" URL does not work in Rails 3.0.3 and earlier versions.

I recommend installing rvm, the "Ruby Version Manager":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/, to manage multiple versions of Rails.

Check that appropriate versions of Ruby and Rails are installed in your development environment:
@$ ruby -v@
@$ rails -v@

h2. Generating the Application

For the *rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber* app, generate a new Rails application with the command:

@$ rails new APP_NAME -m https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates/raw/master/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber-template.rb -T -J@

Use the @-T -J@ flags to skip Test::Unit files and Prototype files.

For the *rails3-mongoid-devise* app, generate a new Rails application with the command:

@$ rails new APP_NAME -m https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates/raw/master/rails3-mongoid-devise-template.rb -T -O -J@

Use the @-T -O -J@ flags to skip Test::Unit files, Active Record files, and Prototype files.

For the *rails3-mongoid-omniauth* app, generate a new Rails application with the command:

@$ rails new APP_NAME -m https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates/raw/master/rails3-mongoid-omniauth-template.rb -T -O -J@

Use the @-T -O -J@ flags to skip Test::Unit files, Active Record files, and Prototype files.

For the *rails3-subdomain-devise* app:

@$ rails new APP_NAME -m https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates/raw/master/rails3-subdomain-devise-template.rb -T -O -J@

Use the @-T -O -J@ flags to skip Test::Unit files, Active Record files, and Prototype files.

bq. You MUST be using Rails 3.0.4 or newer. Generating a Rails application from an "HTTPS" URL does not work in Rails 3.0.3 and earlier versions.

This creates a new Rails app (with the @app_name@ you provide) on your computer.

h2. The Recipes

For your reference, here's an annotated list of available "recipes for the Rails Apps Composer gem":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-apps-recipes.html. For an up-to-date list, browse the repository "recipes directory":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer/tree/master/recipes.

h2. Documentation and Support

This is the only documentation.

h4. Customizing the Template

If you wish to "change the recipe" to generate the app with your own customized options, you can copy and edit the template file. However, it is better to use the "rails3_devise_wizard":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3_devise_wizard gem to create a new application template. You'll find newer versions of the recipes that make up the application template. You may find issues have been identified and (perhaps) fixed. And it will be easier to maintain your application template if you work from the "rails3_devise_wizard":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3_devise_wizard gem.

h4. Writing Recipes

To understand the code in these templates, take a look at "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions. Your recipes can use any methods provided by "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions or "Rails::Generators::Actions":http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html.
